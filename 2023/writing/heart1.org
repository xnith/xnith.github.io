#+title: illumination of the heart

Avalokiteshvara,

today I fixed my ceiling light

it lit up my home in an alien way

one might call it a new perspective

but spatially it remained the same

illuminated from within

i come back to you

Shariputra,

form is naught but void

the shadows bring forth new meaning

void is naught but form

the meaning is lost between pillowcases

Sixth patriarch,

neither wind nor flag, thus

movement becomes a paradox

for void cannot shift form

and form cannot shift void

you remind me of my heart

and my heart is forced to perceive

what is nothing but a sum of nothings

conceived in bad faith

deduced from flawed theorems

and my body is forced to contain

what is more than a sum of parts

unknowingly taking steps

guided by a higher order

i come back to my heart
